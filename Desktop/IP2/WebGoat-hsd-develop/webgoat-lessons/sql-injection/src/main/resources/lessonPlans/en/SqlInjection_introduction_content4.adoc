=== Data Control Language (DCL)

DCL is used to create privileges to allow users accessing and manipulating the database.

If an attacker uses SQL injection of the DCL type to manipulate your database, he will violate one of the following protection goals of information security: confidentiality (grant) & availability (revoke). Attackers could grand themselves admin privileges or revoke admin rights from an administrator.


* DCL commands are used for providing security to database objects.
* GRANT - allows user access privileges to the database.
* REVOKE - withdraws user access privileges given by using the GRANT command.
* Example:
** GRANT CREATE TABLE +
   TO operator;
** This statement gives all users of the operator-role the privilege to create new tables in the database.
