== Consequences of SQL-Injection

=== A successful SQL-Injection exploit can:
* read and modify sensitive data from the database.
* execute administrative operations on the database.
** shutdown or auditing the DBMS.
** truncate tables and logs.
** add users.
* recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system.
* issue commands to the operating system.

=== SQL-Injection attacks allow attackers to:
* spoof identity.
* tamper with existing data.
* cause repudiation issues such as voiding transactions or changing balances.
* allow the complete disclosure of all data on the system.
* destroy data or make it otherwise unavailable.
* become administrator of the database server.
