== Compromising Integrity with SQL query chaining
After compromising the confidentiality of the data in the previous lesson, this time we're going to compromise the *integrity* of data by using SQL *query chaining*.

The integrity of any data can be compromised. For example if an attacker changes information that he shouldn't even be able to access.

=== What is SQL query chaining?
Query chaining is exactly what it sounds like. When query chaining, you try to append one or more queries to the end of the actual query.
You can do this by using the *;* metacharacter which marks the end of a query and that way allows to start another one right after it within the same line.

=== It's your turn!
You just found out that Tobi and Bob both seem to earn more money than you!
Of course you can't leave it at that. +
Better go and _change your own salary so you are earning the most!_
