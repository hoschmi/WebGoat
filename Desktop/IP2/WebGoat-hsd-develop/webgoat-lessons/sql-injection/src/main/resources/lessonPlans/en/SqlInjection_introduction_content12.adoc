== Try It!   Numeric SQL injection

The query in the code builds a dynamic query as seen in the previous example.  The query in the code builds a dynamic query by concatenating a number making it susceptible to Numeric SQL injection:

--------------------------------------------------
"select * from users where Login_Count = " + Login_Count + " and USERID = "  + UserID;
--------------------------------------------------

Try to retrieve all the date from the users table, using the two input fields below.

Warning: Only one of these fields is susceptible to SQL injection. You need to find out which one to successfully retrieve all the data.
